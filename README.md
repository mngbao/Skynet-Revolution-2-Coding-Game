# Skynet-Revolution-2-Coding-Game!
## Story  
Skynet is responding to your intrusion and has activated additional defenses:
Most of the links have been reinforced: your virus no longer has the possibility to destroy a link between two ordinary nodes, it can now only sever links leading to gateways. If it attempts to cut a link between two ordinary nodes it will be detected and deleted.
Nodes may now be connected to up to two gateways!
